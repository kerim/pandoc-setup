# My Pandoc Setup
This repository contains documents I use for my custom Pandoc Setup, designed for use in exporting Obsidian documents with Zotero citations. Full documentation can be found [here](https://garden.oxus.net/technology/customizing-obsidian-to-word/).

Adapted from the document found [here](https://github.com/maehr/academic-pandoc-template/), which seems to be close to the default used by Pandoc (if not identical). 

Major modifications are:

- all black (no blue headers)
- all Times New Roman (I'm used to it)
- justified text for body
- 1.5 spacing throughout
